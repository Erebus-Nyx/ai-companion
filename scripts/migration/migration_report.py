🎉 === AI COMPANION LIVE2D MIGRATION COMPLETE ===

✅ MIGRATION SUCCESSFUL! The AI Companion Live2D models have been successfully 
   migrated from the repository static assets to the user data directory.

📁 NEW STRUCTURE:
   • Models Location: ~/.local/share/ai-companion/live2d_models/
   • Database: ~/.local/share/ai-companion/databases/live2d.db
   • Static Route: /live2d_models/ (served by Flask)

🎭 AVAILABLE MODELS (7 total):
   1. 🎭 hiyori (10 motions) ✅
   2. 🎭 haruka (295 motions) ✅  
   3. 🎭 epsilon (0 motions) ⚠️
   4. 🎭 tsumiki (0 motions) ⚠️
   5. 🎭 haru (0 motions) ⚠️
   6. 🎭 iori (0 motions) ⚠️
   7. 🎭 Kitu (0 motions) ⚠️

📊 DATABASE STATUS:
   • Total Models: 7
   • Total Motions: 305
   • All model paths valid: ✅
   • Phantom models removed: ✅

🔧 CHANGES MADE:
   1. ✅ Updated database model paths from 'static/assets/' to 'live2d_models/'
   2. ✅ Fixed Live2D model scanner to use ~/.local/share/ai-companion/live2d_models
   3. ✅ Added Flask route '/live2d_models/' to serve models from user directory
   4. ✅ Updated JavaScript config to use '/live2d_models' URL
   5. ✅ Fixed motion file paths in app_routes_live2d.py
   6. ✅ Updated all utility scripts to use user data directory
   7. ✅ Cleaned phantom models from database
   8. ✅ Populated valid models and motions

🚀 NEXT STEPS:
   1. ⏳ Populate motions for remaining 5 models (epsilon, tsumiki, haru, iori, Kitu)
   2. ⏳ Test web interface to confirm model loading works
   3. ⏳ Verify avatar removal functionality works correctly
   4. ⏳ Clean up old database files in src/ directories (optional)

🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED:
   ✅ Models directory now uses standard user data location
   ✅ No more hardcoded paths to repository assets
   ✅ Database only contains valid, existing models
   ✅ People panel will show actual loaded models (no more phantom "Miku 2", "Example")
   ✅ Model discovery API will return valid models
   ✅ Avatar removal functionality should work correctly

💡 TECHNICAL DETAILS:
   • Database Manager: Uses separated databases pattern
   • Model Paths: Relative paths 'live2d_models/{model_name}'
   • Web Serving: Flask route serves from ~/.local/share/ai-companion/live2d_models
   • URL Format: /live2d_models/{model_name}/{file_path}

🎉 The migration is complete and the AI Companion should now properly discover 
   and manage Live2D models from the user data directory!
