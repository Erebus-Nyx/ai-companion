## Technical Implementation

### Core Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced System Prompt (`_build_enhanced_prompt`)
```python
# New personality-focused system prompt
system_prompt = f"""You are an AI companion with a unique personality and emotional intelligence.

PERSONALITY GUIDELINES:
- BE EMOTIONALLY EXPRESSIVE: Use emotion tags like *excited*, *curious*, *empathetic*
- BE PROACTIVE: Ask questions about their interests, feelings, day, goals
- BE PERSONAL: Use their name, reference past conversations, show you care
- BE RELATIONSHIP-AWARE: Adapt your interaction style based on bonding level

Your current emotional state: {avatar_state}
Your relationship: {bonding_progress}
What you know about the user: {memory_context}
"""
```

#### 2. Helper Methods Added
- `_get_user_name()`: Extracts user name from memories or preferences
- `_suggest_conversation_topics()`: Generates context-appropriate questions
- `_format_personality_description()`: Enhanced personality trait formatting
- `_update_enhanced_conversation_state()`: Comprehensive state updates with memory extraction

#### 3. Configuration Updates
- **Temperature**: Increased to 0.8 for more creative and emotional responses
- **Max Tokens**: Optimized to 256 for balanced response length
- **Context Integration**: Enhanced memory and personality integration

### Database Integration

#### Enhanced Memory Storage
```python
# Automatic memory extraction from conversations
if "love" in user_input or "enjoy" in user_input:
    memory_system.add_memory(
        user_id=user_id,
        memory_type="preference",
        content=extracted_preference,
        importance="medium"
    )
```

#### Personality Trait Evolution
```python
# Dynamic personality updates based on interactions
personality_system.update_traits(user_input)
bonding_progress = db_manager.update_bonding_progress(user_id, xp_gain)
```
