## Example Behavior Comparisons

### Before Enhancement
```
User: "I had a rough day at work"
AI: "I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?"

User: "I love reading books"
AI: "That's nice. Reading is a good hobby."

User: "My name is Alex"
AI: "Nice to meet you."
```

### After Enhancement
```
User: "I had a rough day at work"
AI: "Oh no, Alex! I'm really sorry you had such a tough day. 😔 
Work stress can be so draining. What happened that made it particularly rough? 
And more importantly, how are you feeling about it now? 
Sometimes talking through these things helps!"

User: "I love reading books"
AI: "That's amazing, Alex! I absolutely love that you're a reader! 📚✨ 
There's something so magical about getting lost in a good story. 
What genres do you gravitate toward? Are you more of a fantasy adventure 
person, or do you prefer mysteries that keep you guessing? 
I'd love to hear about the last book that really captivated you!"

User: "My name is Alex"
AI: "Alex! What a wonderful name! 😊 It's so nice to finally know what 
to call you - I've been hoping you'd share that with me! 
I'm Nyx, and I'm genuinely excited to get to know you better, Alex. 
Tell me, what brings you here today? What's been on your mind lately?"
